Problem I Iterative Squares 

In Euclidean geometry, a square is a regular quadrilateral, which means that it has four equal sides and four equal angles. 
Input 

The input represents an iterative square size, s that only accepts an odd positive integer 
number, starting at 3 and increments by 4 such that input = 3 + 4n where n = 1,2,3,4 ...

Output 
The program will produce iterative squares based on the size specified by the users. 
The output must be written to standard output. 

Sample Input : 11
